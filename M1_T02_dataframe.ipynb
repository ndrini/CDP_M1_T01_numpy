    "- YEAR: Year in which each of the study samples was collected. In this case, all the samples coincide in the year 2008, however, for studies of greater magnitude and greater temporal amplitude, it is necessary to limit the temporal variable of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- MONTH: Month in which each of the study samples were collected. This parameter varies on a scale from 1 to 12, with 1 being the month of January and 12 being the month of December. As in the previous case, all the samples coincide in the month of January, however, for studies of greater magnitude and greater temporal amplitude, it is necessary to limit the temporal variable of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- DAY_OF_MONTH: Day of the month on which each study sample was collected. This parameter varies on a scale from 1 to 31, coinciding with the numbering of the monthly day of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- DAY_OF_WEEK: Day of the week on which each study sample was collected. This parameter varies on a scale from 1 to 7, with 1 being the number equivalent to Monday and 7 being the equivalent to Sunday. Both this data and the previous one may be necessary to estimate which day of the week (eg the beginning of the weekend) or which day of the month (eg the beginning of the month) it is estimated that there may be more congestion and hence more flight delays.\n",
    "\n",
    "- DEP_TIME: Departure time. Flight departure time in real local time (LMT) expressed as a set of four digits, the first two being the hour and the last two being the minutes. Time computed at the moment in which the aircraft leaves the door or gate. Essential data to calculate and forecast collapses based on the time of day, peak hours and work peaks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- CRS_DEP_TIME: Computerized Reservations Systems (CRS) departure time. Time that each airline has computed as departure time. It can be defined as the departure time that the company estimates at which each flight will depart. Very useful data to check the difference between the actual departure time and the time estimated by the company. Indicator of the \"on-time performance\" of each airline.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ARR_TIME: Arrival time. Arrival time of the flight in real local time (LMT) expressed as a set of four digits, the first two being the hour and the last two being the minutes. Time computed at the moment the aircraft's nosewheel hits the Tarmac. Essential data to calculate and forecast collapses based on the time of day, peak hours and work peaks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- CRS_ARR_TIME: Computerized Reservations Systems (CRS) arrival time. Time that each airline has computed as arrival time. It can be defined as the departure time that the company estimates at which each flight will arrive. Very useful data to check the difference between the real time of arrival and the time estimated by the company. Indicator of the \"on-time performance\" of each airline.\n",
    "\n",
    "- UNIQUE_CARRIER: Name in initials of the airline from which the data sample is collected. Necessary data to associate each delay with each airline and be able to estimate and predict which companies produce more delays. Character string.\n",
    "\n",
    "- FL_NUM: FlightNumber. Flight number of each sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "- TAIL_NUM: TailNumber. Set of numbers and letters that make up the registration record of each aircraft, located in the tail of the plane. This number is unique for each aircraft and its format depends on the country of registration (eg in the case of the USA it is made up of the letter November plus a set of digits). It can be found both in the front and rear of the plane and under the planes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ACTUAL_ELAPSED_TIME: Actual flight time, from origin departure to destination arrival, expressed in minutes as a set of integers. Useful data for the estimation and identification of behaviors or delays en route.\n",
    "\n",
    "- CRS_ELAPSED_TIME: Computerized Reservations Systems (CRS) elapsed time. Time that each airline has computed in its system as flight time, from departure at origin to arrival at destination, expressed in minutes as a set of integers. Useful data for the estimation and identification of behaviors or delays en route and the difference with the real time of flight for the calculation of the on-time performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- AIR_TIME: Real flight time in air, from departure at origin to arrival at destination, counted from when the plane leaves the runway until it comes into contact with it again, expressed in minutes as an integer. Useful data for the estimation and identification of behaviors or delays en route.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ARR_DELAY: Difference between the arrival time of CRS or estimated by the company and the actual arrival time at destination, expressed in minutes as an integer. Useful information to identify the source of a problem or delay.\n",
    "\n",
    "- DEP_DELAY: Difference between the departure time of CRS or estimated by the company and the actual departure time at origin, expressed in minutes as a number e"
